Visayan Spotted Deer: I still remember when there were more of us. When we had a wider home. When there were moreâ€¦everything. Now we can go on for days, probably weeks before seeing another of the same species. 
Visayan Spotted Deer: Thank you, Guardian. These saplings are our hope. One day, it will be part of my home, part of nature. Every tree feels like a step towards rejuvenation. Go now, guardian. There is more for you to do, I shall see you soon after.
